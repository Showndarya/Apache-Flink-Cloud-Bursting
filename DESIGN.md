<h4 style="text-align: center;"> Addressing transient workload spikes with Cloud bursting in Apache Flink <br/>

1. **Problem statement:** 
2. **Proposed Solution:**
3. **Expectations:**

   We choose to implement a simple architecture first and incrementally add functionalities and variations to it later. The first version is expected to be delivered in the mid-term which comprises only a basic functional Flink pipeline and a node connecting to AWS Lambda Function. This approach is fast to kick start and flexible for future evolutions. During the first phase of this project, we expect every member of our team will have a  rudimentary understanding of Flink and Lambda Function regardless of their roles and there should be no blocker during this process.

   An alternative approach is developing the fully functional cloud burst mechanism from scratch. The advantage of this approach is that it reduces the overall workload. However, this introduces more complexity in project management and might produce more workloads in late stage development.
